************************ BAckend Url ****************
1.It is assumed that backend will run at "http://localhost:3000",hence same have been hardcoded in file '/app/js/services/dataServices.js'.
2.Suppose you backendProject is deployed at different URL(including different port) then make sure "baseUrl" String Object is changed at location mentioned in comment 1.

Note: This Project can be deployed: 
	1. Using Node.


*************** 1.  Steps to deploy using Node ******************

Note: I assume that Node and NPM are installed on your machine,If not then install both and then follow below steps.

1.Extract "ToDoListAppFrontEnd.zip",Go to directory "ToDoListAppFrontEnd".
2.Inside the directory,following files and folder should be visible.
   2.a.app folder
   2.b.gulpfile.js
   2.c.package.json.
   2.d.screenshots folder
3.If you are not at this hiererchy then make sure you are pointing at this level.
4.Open the command window at this level.
5.In command window run the following command "npm start".
6.It will download all dependencies and automatically open the Chrome Browser pointing to webapp.

Note: It is assumed that port "8081" is free while running this demo.If not then configure port available in "gulpfile.js"
	by replacing "8081" by the port number which is free.Final String will look like. e.g. var port="8083"; or var port="8082"; .

Note  :It is assumed that chrome browser is installed on machine,if not then install and follow above procedure. 

Note:If above procedure fails due to restricted access to download via NPM then follow Tomcat method to deploy the project.










************* Known Issues ********************************

1.Given the Wireframe reference,best have been tried to fullfill minimum requirement to the best of understanding.
2.Rather concentrating more on feature due to time restriction,UI has been somewhat improved in terms of look.
3.Identation may not be proper due to IDE mismatch.Request to ignore at few, though atmost care is taken.
